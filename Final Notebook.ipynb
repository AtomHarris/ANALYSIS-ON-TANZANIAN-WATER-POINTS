    "***\n",
    "Tanzania, the fifth most populus country in Africa, has expereinced significant economic growth over the years, however despite considerable investment in water supply infrastructure from donor funding and the government, a significant proportion of its population remains without proper access to improved drinking water.With their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to halve the proportion of people that do not have access to water services by 2015, Tanzania only increased its access to improved drinking water from 54 percent to 56 percent [JMP, 2015](https://www.unwater.org/sites/default/files/app/uploads/2020/04/WHOUNICEF-Joint-Monitoring-Program-for-Water-Supply-and-Sanitation-JMP-%e2%80%93-2015-Update_-ENG.pdf). The country now faces a difficult task of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to provide universal coverage of safe water by 2030.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their efforts one persistent problem that has adversely affected the country’s effort in increasing access to improved water  services  is  the  prevailing  high  levels  of  non-functionality  or  failures  of  its  current  water infrastructures  and  in  particular,  water points and while this issue is previlant in Africa, evidence indicates that the  problem  of water point failures  may  be relatively more serious in  Tanzania with some estimates putting the figure as high as 44 percent [Banks & Furey, 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312027512_What's_Working_Where_and_for_How_Long_A_2016_Water_Point_Update).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a variety of statistical methods,  we seek to understand the impact of various factors on water points failure and develop a model to predict the possibility of water pump failure with an accuracy and f1_score above 80%. \n"

    "***\n",
    "> We have been tasked by World Bank Group together with the Government of Tanzania to seek a better understanding as to why water point failure is significantly higher in Tanzania as opposed to the rest of Africa as well as a way to reliably predict when water pumps shall fail as they tackle the difficult tast of meeting their 2030 MDG goals in Environmental Sustainability .\n"

    "The research seeks to meet the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analyze Factors Contributing to Water Point Failure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify and evaluate the various factors contributing to the high rate of water point failure in Tanzania compared to the rest of Africa.\n",
    "Perform statistical analysis and data visualization to uncover patterns and correlations within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Develop a Predictive Model for Water Point Failure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilize machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model that can reliably forecast water point failures based on historical data.\n",
    "Evaluate the performance of different models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to identify the most accurate and robust predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assess the Impact of Geographic and Demographic Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate the influence of geographic (e.g., region, district) and demographic (e.g., population, funder) variables on water point functionality.\n",
    "Map the spatial distribution of water point failures to identify high-risk areas and regions needing targeted interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identify Key Indicators for Preventive Maintenance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine key indicators (e.g., construction year, installer, water quality) that can be monitored to predict and prevent water point failures.\n",
    "Develop a set of recommendations for regular monitoring and maintenance practices based on the identified indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Provide Actionable Insights and Recommendations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate actionable insights for stakeholders, including the World Bank Group and the Government of Tanzania, to enhance water point management and sustainability.\n",
    "Suggest policy and infrastructure improvements aimed at reducing water point failure rates and supporting the achievement of the 2030 MDG goals in Environmental Sustainability.\n"

Factors that cannot be modified such as hydrogeological factors play a major role  in  determining  water  points failure during  the  first year  after  installation.    However, management type as well as the type of pump and technology matter considerably more in the short and medium term. These findings highlight the importance of utilizing information on the hydrological characteristics in the design, construction and maintenance of water points. On the other  hand, the technology of water points is a more important factor in explaining failure over time, controlling for other factors.  "
